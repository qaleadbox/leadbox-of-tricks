# Known Issues

| Severity      | Description        |
|--------------------|---------------|
| HIGH | If pop up hiddes before the process finish, causes the reports not be generated |
| MEDIUM | If OCR API was down, the cards should have a new tag "API is offline" |
| MEDIUM | Start a process, reopen popup, it will be not locked(loading) |
| MEDIUM | When any result is found, the icon keeps spinning|
| MEDIUM | Remove all hard code to implement full autodetect approach, occurrances on $data-handler.js > (e.g. "STOCKNUMBER", "KILOMETERS", "VIN", etc) |
| MEDIUM | Report file sometimes is being duplicated
| MEDIUM | Detect small images has not any loading feedback POPUP and SPINNER ICON
| LOW | Small images, if was runned more than once without clean the highlights the vehicle cards will became all red highlighed. THIS IS ONLY VISUAL. DO NOT IMPACTS FUNCTIONALITY.

# Suggestions

* Processes should start when tap ENTER
* When clicked outsite pop up, it closes and the data disappear
* Sometimes the extension process stops unexpectedly when the popup closes
* For check coming soon images, change the stockNumber column to the first on the output CSV file
* for comingsoonimagessize saved locally, save the image id instead the size, or both.
* OCR API is commonly down, should be good to test OCR locally
* "No matching CSV header found for field:" is logging on countychevrolet
* Remove the Field_mapleftover implementation from coming soon images module
* Add a dashboard to user choose options (e.g. debugMode)
* Add to the dashboard the exceptions and the normalization keys
* OCR is false negative on some sites - case the "coming soon" text has a not so readble font
* Add a stop button to break the checking while it is processing
* Elaborate test scenarios to regression
* Build a little test automation (embedded on the extension), tu run after every new code change
* Small images, currently it is reporting below 10KB, desired is 10KB be the minimum but user choose a customized value

Notes
    • Task: <https://3.basecamp.com/5126812/buckets/24988316/todos/7301107305>
    • A frontend application that scans SRP pages for the following:
        - Prices (or lack of prices)
        - Pictures (or coming soon)
    • Local Extension
    • Saves the result to a Word document
    • View More button is a challenge
    • 100% Frontend (no backend, no JSON)
    • Use this page as a reference <https://landrovertoronto.ca/used-vehicles/> and <https://jaguartoronto.com/new-vehicles/>

Action items
    • Research how the View More button works
    • Check if coming soon images have the same class as regular images
    • Make a list of what types of data the application will capture
    • Research how the infinite scroll works
